      "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
      form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the

      the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

      "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including

      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
      publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
      Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

   3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,

      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
      as of the date such litigation is filed.

   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You

          stating that You changed the files; and

      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
          the Derivative Works; and

      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
          as modifying the License.

      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
      the conditions stated in this License.

   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

not to use any API, code or other tools, instruction or service provided by Oculus to enable 
or use a Platform Service other than in compliance with these terms. For more information go 
to https://developer.oculus.com.

• "Oculus Platform Framework" means the suite of Oculus platform services, including but not 
  limited to the Oculus file distribution and update system (enabling distribution and updates 
  of Developer Content by Oculus, including through generated activation Keys), entitlement 
  system, and account authentication, which list may be changed from time to time in Oculus' 
  sole discretion.
• "Application Services" means services provided by Oculus associated with the Platform, 
  including but not limited to in-app purchasing, multiplayer matchmaking, friends, leader boards, 
  achievements, rooms, voice over IP and cloud saves, which list may be changed from time to time 
  in Oculus' sole discretion.
• "Platform" means the Oculus virtual reality platform, including but not limited to the user 
  experience, user interface, store, and social features, usable on Oculus approved hardware or 
  any third-party device or operating system, including but not limited to iOS, Android, Windows, 
  OS X, Linux, and Windows Mobile.
• "Platform Services" means the Oculus Platform Framework and the Application Services.

3.1 Oculus Platform Services. Oculus makes certain Platform Services available to you to include and 
enable in your Developer Content. Developer Content that enables or includes any Platform Service 
must implement the Oculus Platform Framework with that Developer Content. Once your Developer 
Content has been authorized for use of the Platform Services, you are not required to update your 
Developer Content to include new Platform Services Oculus may make available as part of the 
Oculus Platform Framework.

3.2 Limited Authorization. You hereby grant Oculus the limited authorization reasonably necessary 
for Oculus's exercise of its rights and performance of its obligations under this Section 3. 
You agree that Oculus may use its contractors and affiliates for the purposes of exercising 
its rights and licenses set forth in this Section 3.

3.3. Internal Use. You agree that Oculus may grant its employees and internal contractors the 
right to use, perform and display the Developer Content you provide to Oculus for testing, 
evaluation and approval purposes, which shall be on a royalty-free basis.

3.4 Key Provision and Redemption. If you request that Oculus generate activation keys for your 
Developer Content on the Platform ("Keys") and Oculus agrees, you hereby grant Oculus (i) the 
right to generate Keys for you and (ii) a license to make available, reproduce, distribute, 
perform, and display the Developer Content to end users who have submitted a Key to Oculus. 
Oculus agrees to authenticate and make Developer Content available to any end user supplying 
a valid Key (unless the Developer Content has been removed or withdrawn).

3.5 Platform Services Requirements. You will not make any use of any API, software, code or 
other item or information supplied by Oculus in connection with the Platform Services other 
than to enhance the functionality of your Developer Content. In particular, you must not 
(nor enable others to): (i) defame, abuse, harass, stalk, or threaten others, or to promote or 
facilitate any prohibited or illegal activities; (ii) enable any functionality in your Developer 
Content that would generate excessive traffic over the Oculus network or servers that would 
negatively impact other users' experience, or otherwise interfere with or restrict the operation 
of the Platform Services, or Oculus's servers or networks providing the Platform Services; or 
(iii) remove, obscure, or alter any Oculus license terms, policies or terms of service or any 
links to or notices thereto. You may not sublicense any software, firmware or other item or 
information supplied by Oculus in connection with the Platform Service for use by a third party, 
unless expressly authorized by Oculus to do so. You agree not to use (or encourage the use of) the 
Platform Services for mission critical, life saving or ultra-hazardous activities. Oculus may suspend 
operation of or remove any Developer Content that does not comply with the restrictions in this License.

You will not use the Oculus Avatar associated with the Oculus ID of any end user in your Developer 
Content without the express permission of that end user unless, (i) that end user is actively engaged 
with your Developer Content or (ii) that end user remains part of an active session of your Developer 
Content with whom other end users are interacting, whether or not that end user is then online.

any included terms and conditions.

4.2 Your use of third-party materials included in the Oculus SDK may be subject to other terms and 
conditions typically found in separate third-party license agreements or "READ ME" files included with 
such third-party materials. To the extent such other terms and conditions conflict with the terms and 
conditions of this License, the former will control with respect to the applicable third-party materials.

5. THE OCULUS SDK AND ANY COMPONENT THEREOF, THE OCULUS HEADERS, LIBRARIES AND APIS, AND THE PLATFORM SERVICES 
FROM OCULUS AND ITS CONTRIBUTORS ARE PROVIDED "AS IS" AND ANY EXPRESS OR IMPLIED WARRANTIES, INCLUDING, 
BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE ARE 
DISCLAIMED. IN NO EVENT SHALL OCULUS AS THE COPYRIGHT OWNER OR ITS CONTRIBUTORS BE LIABLE FOR ANY DIRECT, 
INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, PROCUREMENT 
OF SUBSTITUTE GOODS OR SERVICES; LOSS OF USE, DATA, OR PROFITS; OR BUSINESS INTERRUPTION) HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON 
ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, STRICT LIABILITY, OR TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE) 
ARISING IN ANY WAY OUT OF THE USE OF THIS OCULUS SDK, THE OCULUS HEADERS, LIBRARIES AND APIS OR THE PLATFORM 
SERVICES, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGE. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT PERMIT THE EXCLUSION OR 
LIMITATION OF IMPLIED WARRANTIES, SO YOU MAY HAVE ADDITIONAL RIGHTS.

6. This License does not grant permission to use the trade names, trademarks, service marks, or product names 
of Oculus, except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the origin of the Oculus SDK, and 
reproducing the content of the License Notice file. Oculus reserves all rights not expressly granted to you 
under this License. Neither the name of Oculus VR, LLC nor the names of Oculus VR, LLC's contributors, licensors, 
employees, or contractors, may be used to endorse or promote products developed using the Oculus SDK without 
specific prior written permission of Oculus VR, LLC.

7. You are responsible for ensuring that your use of the Oculus SDK and your Developer Content, including enabled 
Platform Services, complies with all applicable laws (including privacy laws) wherever your Developer Content is 
made available. You acknowledge and agree that you are solely responsible for any health and safety issues arising 
from your Developer Content.  You will not collect end users' content or information, or otherwise access any Oculus 
site, using automated means (such as harvesting bots, robots, spiders, or scrapers) without Oculus' prior permission.

8. Your acceptance of the terms and conditions of this License in and of itself and for all Developer Content created 
as of March 28, 2016, may be evidenced by any of the following: your usage of the Oculus SDK, or acceptance of the 
license agreement. As this License is updated for future releases of the Oculus SDK, you agree to abide by and meet 
all requirements of future updates of this License for those future Oculus SDK releases, with acceptance evidenced 
by usage of the Oculus SDK or any element thereof and the future updates of this License will apply for that future 
Developer Content that may be developed for or with that future Oculus SDK or any element thereof (i.e., you cannot 
sidestep out of the requirements of future updates of the License by developing against an older release of the Oculus 
SDK or License).

9. Oculus reserves the right to terminate this License and all your rights hereunder immediately in the event you 
materially breach this License.

10. Furthermore, Oculus also reserves the right to cancel or terminate this License for any of the following reasons:

a. Intellectual property infringement by you with Developer Content created by you that is used with or by the Oculus 
   SDK, or any of the Platform Services;
b. Developer Content (including enabling Platform Services) that violates applicable law;
c. Health and safety issues associated with your Developer Content;
d. Failure to comply with or use properly the Oculus Flash Screen Warnings;
e. Use of the Oculus SDK with a commercial product other than an Oculus Approved Product;
f. Failure to provide required notices as set forth above; and
g. Failure to observe the restrictions in Section 3.5.

11. You agree to fully indemnify Oculus from any and all losses, costs, damages and expenses (including reasonable 
attorney's fees) arising out of your Developer Content or any matter set forth in Sections 6, 7 and 10(a) through (g).

12. Oculus may discontinue or change functionality of the Platform Services at any time, and your continued use of the 
Platform Services or use of any modified or additional Platform Services is conditioned upon your adherence to the terms 
of this License, as modified by Oculus from time to time.

13. In the event any provision of this License is determined to be invalid, prohibited or unenforceable by a court or 
other body of competent jurisdiction, this License shall be construed as if such invalid, prohibited or unenforceable 
provision has been more narrowly drawn so as not to be invalid, prohibited or unenforceable.

14. You may not assign any rights or obligations under this License without the advance written consent of Oculus, 
which may be withheld in its sole discretion. Oculus may assign its rights or obligations under this License in its 
sole discretion.

15. Failure of either party at any time to enforce any of the provisions of this License will not be construed as a 
waiver of such provisions or in any way affect the validity of this License or parts thereof.

16. Your remedies under this License shall be limited to the right to collect money damages, if any, and you hereby 
waive your right to injunctive or other equitable relief.

17. You will comply, and will not cause Oculus to not comply (by for example, providing Developer Content to Oculus 
under this Agreement for which required export clearances have not been obtained), with all applicable export control 
laws of the United States and any other applicable governmental authority, including without limitation, the U.S. 
Export Administration Regulations. You agree that this License and the Oculus SDK and accompanying documentation are 
Oculus's confidential information (and is not publicly available), and you will not use it, disclose it or make it 
available to others except in accordance with the terms of this License.

18. This License shall be governed by the laws of the State of California, without giving effect to choice of law principles. 
All disputes relating to this License shall be resolved by binding non-appearance-based arbitration before a neutral 
arbitrator in Santa Clara, California. The arbitration shall be conducted in accordance with the rules and procedures 
of JAMS then in effect, and the judgment of the arbitrator shall be final and capable of entry in any court of competent 
jurisdiction. You and Oculus agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of the courts located within Santa Clara, 
California in connection with any entrance of an arbitrator's judgment or decision or any dispute with respect to the 
arbitration process or procedure or Oculus's exercise of its equitable rights or remedies.
